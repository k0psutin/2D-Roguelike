# 2D-Roguelike

I wanted to start a bigger project, so i began creating a 2D-roguelike game written with Java. The game uses JavaFX, and all the images i use in the game are with CC0-licence. 

By creating a more complex project, i wanted to combine things i learned from Helsinki University online programming course.

Project originally started from creating a randomized dungeon with corridors, and implementing a movable player. Later i thought what if i added some graphics on it.

This project isn't even close to finish, and everything you see here will propably change at somepoint. I will update the project whenever i have time to continue from my work and other studies.

Creative criticism is always welcome.

You can get the tileset for your own project from: https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii
